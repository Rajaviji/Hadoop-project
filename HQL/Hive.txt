In this project, the aadhar dataset analysis is held by hive and hadoop.  
The following steps have been held in this following proje
Step 1: I have generated the uid_enrollment_detail and it is saved in a csv format. 
Step 2: Loaded a dataset in HDFS using the load command.
step 3: Using those data thus the dataset are get analysed through hql and mapreduce algorithms.


Creating the table using the CREATE command:

		> create table uid_enrollment_detail(Registrar string,Enrolment_Agency string,State string,District string,Sub_District string,Pin Code int,Gender string,Age int,Aadhar_generated 			  int,Enrolment_Rejected int,Residents_providing_email int,Residents_providing_mobile_number int)
		> row format delimited
		> fields terminated by '\t';

Loading the table using the LOAD command:

	The dataset is loaded from the local file system. Using the load command thus the dataset which are get loaded into the HDFS.

	>Load data local inpath '/home/victor/Documents/uid_enrollment_detail.csv' into table uid_enrollment_detail;

Thus the dataset are get loaded into the hdfs using the above query.

HQL[Hive Query Language]:

Using this Hql thus the queries are get executed in this project.

The following task is assinged for this project:

Task 1:Number of aadhar identities which are generated in each state
Task 2:Number of aadhar identities which are generated by each Enrollment Agency
Task 3:Top 10 districts with maximum Aadhar identities generated for both Male and Female


Solutions : 

Task 1: Number of aadhar identities which are generated in each state.

	>select state,sum(Aadhar_generated) as count from uid_enrollment_detail group by state order by count DESC;



Task 2: Number of aadhar identities which are generated by each Enrollment_Agency

	>select 'Enrollment_Agency' as Enrollment_Agency, sum(Aadhar_generated) as count from uid_enrollment_detail group by Enrollement Agency order by count DESC;



Task 3: Top 10 districts with maximum Aadhar identities generated for both Male and Female

	>select District,count(CASE WHEN Gender='Male' THEN 1 END) as male_count,
	>count(CASE WHEN Gender='Female' THEN 1 END) as female_count,
	>group by District,
	>order by male_count DESC, female_count DESC,
	>limit 10;
